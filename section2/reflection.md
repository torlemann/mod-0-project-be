## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
 Conditional statements evaluate to true or false and are expressed with operators such as == (equal), > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal to), < (less than), and <= (less than or equal to). _from [jumpstartlab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#9.-conditionals)_

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
an if-statement makes a branch in your code that tells your script, "If this boolean expression is true, then run the code under it, otherwise skip it." _from [learnrubythehardway](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex30.html)_
you might want to use it for your program to return different outputs depending on the inputs.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if statement/output/end

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
with else and elsif

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

weather = 'snowy'

if weather == 'sunny'
  puts "sunscreen"
elsif weather == 'rainy'
  puts "umbrella"
elsif weather == 'snowy'
  puts "coat"
elsif weather == 'icy'
  puts "yak traks"
else
  puts "good to go!"
end
